# Salary Predictor ML 📈

A machine learning project that uses **Simple Linear Regression** to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.



## 🧠 How it Works
This project uses **Supervised Learning**. I fed the model a dataset of historical salaries (`data.csv`). The algorithm (Linear Regression) finds the correlation (the "Line of Best Fit") between experience and income.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python:** Core language.
- **Pandas:** For loading and manipulating the CSV dataset.
- **Scikit-Learn:** For splitting the data and training the Linear Regression algorithm.
- **Matplotlib:** For visualizing the data points and the regression line.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
